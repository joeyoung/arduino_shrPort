### arduino_shrPort

This repository contains several separate arduino format libraries, which enable
sharing of I2C port expander IC. These port expander devices connect to the I2C
bus (pins SCL, SDA, VCC, GND) and then provide 8 or 16 digital I/O bits and 
freeing the arduino digital pins for other uses.

The current version (2020) replaces an earlier start on this capability that was
abandonded because it required modification of other libraries, rendering the
modified versions incompatible with the base arduino. Some of the earlier files
are retained in the `history` folder

To use the library functions, either download the individual library folders 
needed, or the whole repository .zip file and unpack to a temporary folder and
place the libraries you need into the arduino libraries folder within sketchbook.
The arduino library manager doesn't work directly on this whole repository.

The libraries included here are of three different types - expander port sharing
I/O, bridging functions from arduino pin programs to the share ports, and
modified existing libraries. The expander port sharing libraries are:

* `shrPort` - handling PCF8574 and PCF8575 devices (8 and 16 bit)
* `shrMC17` - handling MCP23017 16-bit
* `I2Ccomm` - an empty definition class used by shrXXXX libraries

The bridging functions are:

* `Keypad_exp` - allow Keypad to use I2C port expander pins
* `LiquidCrystal_exp` - extends (modified) LiquidCrystal_I2C
* `flashPin_exp` - non-blocking timers to repeatedly pulse individual pins
* `LcdBarCentreZero_exp` - uses LiquidCrystal_exp to draw bargraph on character displays

The modified existing library:

* LiquidCrystal_I2C - see README document in this version

The purpose of this library development is similar to that of other libraries to
allow I2C I/O posted elsewhere - for example `arduino_keypads`. The additional goal
compared to those previous developments was to separate the I/O port control from
the objects using the port. This arrangement has the minor advantage of not duplicating
the code controlling the port when multiple objects are instantiated, as is the case
with the libraries in `arduino_keypads`. More importantly, only one set of I/O
functions controls the state of the I/O port chip registers thus minimizing the
possibility of different objects interfering with one another.

Excerpts from an example program illustrate the use of these libraries. The example
system has a Keypad, 16 X 2 LCD display and flashPin to pulse the display backlight.
