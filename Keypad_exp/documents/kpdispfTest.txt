Notes regarding the example sketches kpdispfTestXX

May 27/20 G. D. (Joe) Young <jyoung@islandnet.com>

These sketches demonstrate the use of the shrPort libraries to permit extending
the I/O from existing libraries to use the I2C port(s).

kpdispfTest5 is the most comprehensive since it uses two of the shrPort libraries
and runs two keypads, an LCD 16 X 2 character display, and flashPin to signal a
full line on the display. kpdispfTest5alt is to be used with the MKR ZERO because
it also configures an alternate I2C port on pins 0 and 1, and demonstrates the
use of the optional wire reference parameter in the trailing argument of the
shrPort constructors.

The original kpdispfTest (no suffixes!) constructs one large object, kpdf,
that includes Keypad, LiquidCrystal_I2C, and flashPin. It is included here
as documentation, it's probabaly not useful as is. It is rather cumbersome
to set up and not too flexible to use, but nevertheless uses only one set of
I/O expander port functions. Subsequent versions explored comparisons with
separate xxx_I2C objects, with the shrPort versions, etc. The results are
summarized in the comments of kpdispfTest5.
